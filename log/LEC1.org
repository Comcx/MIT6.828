:Operations:
-- Operations are op codes which can be directly translated to machine code.

-- MOVement
*MOV dest, source*

-- ADDition
*ADD dest source*

-- SUBtraction
*SUB dest source*

-- CoMParision
*CMP vleft, vright*

For unsigned integers, there are two flags (bits in the FLAGS register)
that are important: the zero (ZF) and carry (CF) flags. The zero flag is
set (1) if the resulting difference would be zero. The carry flag is used as a
borrow flag for subtraction. Consider a comparison like:
#+begin_src
cmp vleft, vright
#+end_src
The difference of vleft - vright is computed and the flags are set accordingly. 
If the difference of the of CMP is zero, vleft = vright, then ZF is set
(i.e. 1) and the CF is unset (i.e. 0). If vleft > vright, then ZF is unset
and CF is unset (no borrow). If vleft < vright, then ZF is unset and CF
is set (borrow)

For signed integers, there are 3 flags that are important: the ZERO flag(ZF),
OVERFLOW flag(OF), and SIGN flag(SF). The OVERFLOW flag
is set if the result of an operation overflows (or underflows). The sign flag
is set if the result of an operation is negative. If vleft = vright, the ZF
is set (just as for unsigned integers). If vleft > vright, ZF is unset and
SF = OF. If vleft < vright, ZF is unset and SF /= OF.

-- JuMPs

-- Unconsitional jump
*JMP address*

--------------------------------------
| *JZ*  | branches only if ZF is set   |
| *JNZ* | branches only if ZF is unset |
| *JO*  | branches only if OF is set   |
| *JNO* | branches only if OF is unset |
| *JS*  | branches only if SF is set   |
| *JNS* | branches only if SF is unset |
| *JC*  | branches only if CF is set   |
| *JNC* | branches only if CF is unset |
| *JP*  | branches only if PF is set   |
| *JNP* | branches only if PF is unset |
p.s. /PF/ is the parity flag which 
     indicates the _odd or evenness_ of a result.



There several variations of /JMP/ instruction:

*SHORT* 
This jump is very limited in range. It can only move up or down
_128 bytes_ in memory. The advantage of this type is that it uses less
memory than the others. It uses a single signed byte to store the
displacement of the jump. The displacement is how many bytes to
move ahead or behind. (The displacement is added to EIP). To specify
a short jump, use the SHORT keyword immediately before the label in
the JMP instruction.

*NEAR* 
This jump is the _default_ type for both unconditional and conditional branches, 
it can be used to jump to _any location in a segment_. 
Actually, the 80386 supports two types of near jumps. One
uses two bytes for the displacement. This allows one to move up or
down roughly 32,000 bytes. The other type uses four bytes for the
displacement, which of course allows one to move to any location in
the code segment. The four byte type is the default in 386 protected
mode. The two byte type can be specified by putting the WORD keyword
before the label in the JMP instruction.

*FAR* 
This jump allows control to move to _another code segment_. This is a
very rare thing to do in 386 protected mode.

-- More(advanced) jumps
| Signed     | Unsigned                                                       |
|------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| *JE*       | branches if vleft = vright JE branches if vleft = vright       |
| *JNE*      | branches if vleft 6= vright JNE branches if vleft 6= vright    |
| *JL, JNGE* | branches if vleft < vright JB, JNAE branches if vleft < vright |
| *JLE, JNG* | branches if vleft ≤ vright JBE, JNA branches if vleft ≤ vright |
| *JG, JNLE* | branches if vleft > vright JA, JNBE branches if vleft > vright |
| *JGE, JNL* | branches if vleft ≥ vright JAE, JNB branches if vleft ≥ vright |




-- LOOPs
*LOOP*
| *LOOP*           | Decrements ECX, if ECX 6= 0, branches to label      |
| *LOOPE, LOOPZ*   | Decrements ECX (FLAGS register is not modified), if |
|                  | ECX /= 0 and ZF = 1, branches                       |
| *LOOPNE, LOOPNZ* | Decrements ECX (FLAGS unchanged), if ECX /=         |
|                  | 0 and ZF = 0, branches                              |



-------------------------------------------

-- Bit operations

| *SHL obj bits* | Logic shift left       |
| *SHR obj bits* | Logic shift right      |
| *SAL obj bits* | Arithmetic shift left  |
| *SAR obj bits* | Arithmetic shift right |
| *ROL obj bits* | Rotate left            |
| *ROR obj bits* | Rotate right           |
| *RCL obj bits* |                        |
| *RCR obj bits* |                        |
p.s. /obj/ means object, /bits/ refers number of bits to move


-- Boolean operations

| *and* | *or* | *xor* | *not* |
*TEST* operation

The TEST instruction performs an AND operation, but does not store
the result. 
It only sets the FLAGS register based on what the result would
be (much like how the CMP instruction performs a subtraction but only sets
FLAGS).


------------------------------------------

-- Stack

*PUSH* | *POP*


-- Call & Ret

The *CALL* instruction makes an unconditional jump to a subprogram and 
pushes the address of the next instruction on the stack. 

The *RET* instruction pops off an address and jumps to that address. 
When using these instructions, it is very important that one manage the stack correctly 
so that the right number is popped off by the RET instruction!


:end:



:Directions:
-- Directions are ad-hoc codes which can be used to direct assembler to generate code.
-- Here character 'X' is special for different formats:
| Unit        | Letter |
|-------------+--------|
| Byte        | B      |
| Word        | W      |
| Double word | D      |
| Quad word   | Q      |
| Ten bytes   | T      |

*/symbol/ equ /value/*

*%define*   -- like C #define

*%include*  -- like C #include

*res/X/*    -- reserves room(unit /X/)

*d/X/*      -- reserve and initalize

*times*     -- for repeated reserve directions

:end:

*Labels* can be used conveniently: 

plain labels are their address;

squared(e.g. [label]) labels are contents inside the address of the label

:Size-Specifiers:
-- Size specifiers are used when the assembler can not infer the actual data's size of operation.

-- e.g. Suppose we have code:
#+begin_src
mov [L6], 1
#+end_src
Here, the assembler has no idea what the actual size of /[L6]/ is.
To solve this, we simply add a /size specifier/:
#+begin_src
mov dword [L6], 1
#+end_src

All size specifiers are:

*byte | word | dword | qword | tword*

:end:

*[Pitfall]* The book says file /asm_io.inc/ can be downloaded from url in book,
however, I found nothing but a plain article.
Finally, I found that the link has been updated to:

[[http://pacman128.github.io/pcasm/]]

:( cost me a lot of time.........
compiler /first.asm/ successfully!!! <2019-01-22 Tue>




**** DONE [Book] Brennan's Guide to Inline Assembly -> 
     learn AT&T syntax, which is semantically equivalent to Intel syntax.

- *Register naming*
Register names are prefixed with "*%*". To reference eax:
| AT&T  | %eax |
| Intel | eax  |

- *Source/Destination Ordering*
In AT&T syntax (which is the UNIX standard, BTW) the source is always on the left, 
and the destination is always on the right.
So let's load ebx with the value in eax:

| AT&T  | movl %eax, %ebx |
| Intel | mov  ebx, eax   |

- *Constant value/immediate value format*
You must prefix all constant/immediate values with "$".
Let's load eax with the address of the "C" variable booga, which is static.

| AT&T  | movl $_booga, %eax |
| Intel | mov eax, _booga    |

Now let's load ebx with /0xd00d/:
| AT&T  | movl $0xd00d, %ebx |
| Intel | mov ebx, d00dh     |

- *Operator size specification*
You must suffix the instruction with one of *b, w, or l* to 
specify the width of the destination register as a byte, word or longword. 
If you omit this, GAS (GNU assembler) will attempt to guess. 
You don't want GAS to guess, and guess wrong! Don't forget it.

| AT&T  | movw %ax, %bx |
| Intel | mov bx, ax    |

- *Referencing memory*
DJGPP uses 386-protected mode, so you can forget all that real-mode addressing junk, 
including the restrictions on which register has what default segment, 
which registers can be base or index pointers. 
Now, we just get 6 general purpose registers. 
(7 if you use ebp, but be sure to restore it yourself or compile with -fomit-frame-pointer.)
Here is the canonical format for 32-bit addressing:

| AT&T  | immed32(basepointer,indexpointer,indexscale)      |
| Intel | [basepointer + indexpointer*indexscale + immed32] |

--------------------------
- *Inline assembly*
Here is the basic format:
#+begin_src c
asm ( "statements" : output_registers : input_registers : clobbered_registers);

/* e.g.*/
asm ("cld\n\t"
     "rep\n\t"
     "stosl"
     : /* no output registers */
     : "c" (count), "a" (fill_value), "D" (dest)
     : "%ecx", "%edi" );
#+end_src

Here's the list of register loading codes that you'll be likely to use:

| a   | eax                                                         |
| b   | ebx                                                         |
| c   | ecx                                                         |
| d   | edx                                                         |
| S   | esi                                                         |
| D   | edi                                                         |
| I   | constant value (0 to 31)                                    |
| q,r | dynamically allocated register (see below)                  |
| g   | eax, ebx, ecx, edx or variable in memory                    |
| A   | eax and edx combined into a 64-bit integer (use long longs) |

*Important note*: If your assembly statement must execute where you put it, 
(i.e. must not be moved out of a loop as an optimization), 
put the keyword /volatile/ after asm and before the ()'s. 
To be ultra-careful, use:
#+begin_src c
__asm__ __volatile__ (...whatever...);
#+end_src
However, I would like to point out that if your assembly's only purpose is to calculate the output registers, 
with no other side effects, 
you should leave off the volatile keyword so your statement will be processed into GCC's 
common subexpression elimination optimization.



**** TODO [Book] 80386 Programmer's Reference Manual

*** DONE Build JOS environment [little difficult]
**** DONE Build *QEMU*
To build qemu for 6.828, one need to follow the instructions written
on 6.828 offical guide!
I followed everything in guide, but I still ran into /error/ while trying to
install /qemu/:
- *Situation 1: Python2.7 needed*
We have to use python under version 3 :(  

*[Solution]* Install python2.7, in my Arch, command:
#+begin_src shell
sudo pacman -S python2
#+end_src
then, in configuration phase, add option: --python=python2.7

- *Situation 2: Undefined reference to major or minor*
This cost me large amount of time to fix.
Finally, I found this /upgrade/

Android's had <sys/sysmacros.h> for a long time, we are likely to
remove the transtive include from <sys/types.h>

Therefore,
  
*[Solution]* add code:
#+begin_src c
#include <sys/sysmacros.h>
#+end_src

- *Situation 3: qemu-nox*
Since I am using pure tty in Arch, when I tried to command:

make qemu,
  
I got /error/: could not connect server.

*[Solution]* use command:  
#+begin_src shell
make qemu-nox
#+end_src

Now I've successfully built /QEMU/ environment! :)


**** DONE Debugging *QEMU*
Unfortunately, I ran into trouble again while debugging.
I followed instructions:
1) Command:
#+begin_src shell
make qemu-gdb
#+end_src
2) Open another terminal window, command in the same directory:
#+begin_src shell
make gdb
#+end_src

then, I got error message:
#+begin_src
error while loading shared libraries: libreadline.so.8
#+end_src

I tried to upgrade readline:
#+begin_src shell
sudo pacman -S readline
#+end_src

Then, cd /usr/lib, I found:

libreadline.so.8

which is already up-to-date.

However, when I ran: make qemu-gdb, error occurred again:
#+begin_src
error while loading shared libraries: libreadline.so.7
#+end_src

This time lack version 7 2333333333 :(
Finally, I cd /usr/lib, command:
#+begin_src shell
sudo ln -s libreadline.so.7 libreadline.so.8
#+end_src
to get both version 7 and 8 and everything's ok now.

**** NEXT [3/4] Understanding the *Boot loader*
***** DONE The Boot sector
Most boot codes lies in the first sector of a bootable device(e.g. CD-ROM).
However, Some modern machines are now using 2 sectors to load boot codes.

See _"El Torito" Bootable CD-ROM Format Specification._

***** NEXT [1/3] Read the Boot Codes
****** DONE Reading /boot.S/
Since the codes in /boot.S/ are not so much, I'll analysis these codes in detail.

However, while reading the source code, I found that I have little knowledge of 8086
Intel architecture, which is very curial to fully understand /boot.S/.

Therefore, I decide to learn the main usages of /boot.S/(I do not have enough time to learn everything).
I shall study 80386 programming later. Here I list main purposes of /boot.S/:

- First, the boot loader switches the processor from real mode to 32-bit protected mode, 
  because it is only in this mode that software can access all the memory above 1MB 
  in the processor's physical address space.

- Second, the boot loader reads the kernel from the hard disk 
  by directly accessing the IDE disk device registers via the x86's special I/O instructions. 

****** NEXT Reading /boot.asm/
Well, little difficult for me currently...
Do this later

****** NEXT Reading /bootmain.c/
later

***** DONE Learning *GDB* commands
| *si(stepi)* | next                                                            |

| *x/Ni*      | Display the N assembly instructions starting at addr.           |
| *b *addr*   | Set a breakpoint at the EIP addr.                               |
| *c*         | Continue to a break point                                       |

***** DONE [3/3] [Exercise 3] Set breakpoints and answering questions
****** DONE Set break point at 0x7c00 & trace /boot.S/
****** DONE Trace into bootmain() in /boot/main.c/ and then into readsect()
****** DONE [4/4] Answering questions
******* DONE At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code? 
	What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?
After [ 0:7c2d] => 0x7c2d: ljmp $0x8,$0x7c32，i.s. /ljmp $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg/ in boot.S,
the address turned into 0x7c32.
******* DONE What is the last instruction of the boot loader executed, 
	and what is the first instruction of the kernel it just loaded?
#+begin_src c
((void (*)(void)) (ELFHDR->e_entry))();
movw $0x1234,0x472
#+end_src
******* DONE Where is the first instruction of the kernel?
/kern/entry.S/
******* DONE How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read in order to 
	fetch the entire kernel from disk? Where does it find this information?

2: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 101, a[2] = 102, a[3] = 103
3: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 300, a[2] = 301, a[3] = 302
4: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 400, a[2] = 301, a[3] = 302
5: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 128144, a[2] = 256, a[3] = 302
6: a = 0x7ffd791b0b40, b = 0x7ffd791b0b44, c = 0x7ffd791b0b41

#+end_src

- Analysis:
line 1 ~ 4 are simple for me, I only analysis line 5:

| 0xb0b40 | 0xb0b41 | 0xb0b42 | 0xb0b43 |
|      90 |      01 |      00 |      00 |

The element's stored in address 0xb0b44~0xb0b47, whose value is 301, i.e.0x0000012D.

| 0xb0b44 | 0xb0b45 | 0xb0b46 | 0xb0b47 |
|      2D |      01 |      00 |      00 |

After pointer c is updated, its address turned into 0xbfb4bf89~0xbfb4bf8c, assigned with 500, i.e.0x000001F4
Therefore, the memory became:
| 0xb0b40 | 0xb0b41 | 0xb0b42 | 0xb0b43 |
|      90 |      F4 |      01 |      00 |
| 0xb0b44 | 0xb0b45 | 0xb0b46 | 0xb0b47 |
|      00 |      01 |      00 |      00 |

So, the value of a[1] had turned into 0x0001F490 = 128144, and a[2]'s value turned into 0x00000100 = 256.

p.s. It is important to point out that, since I'm using intel architecture, my machine uses /little endian method/.

***** DONE Learning *ELF* format
Extracted from /MIT6.828 LAB1 page/:

For purposes of 6.828, you can consider an ELF executable to be a header with loading information, 
followed by several program sections, each of which is a contiguous chunk of code or data intended to 
be loaded into memory at a specified address. 
The boot loader does not modify the code or data; it loads it into memory and starts executing it.

An ELF binary starts with a _fixed-length ELF header_, 
followed by a variable-length program header listing each of the program sections to be loaded. 
The C definitions for these ELF headers are in inc/elf.h. The program sections we're interested in are:

*.text*: The program's executable instructions.
*.rodata*: Read-only data, such as ASCII string constants produced by the C compiler. 
(We will not bother setting up the hardware to prohibit writing, however.)
*.data*: The data section holds the program's initialized data, 
such as global variables declared with initializers like int x = 5;.

Command test: 
#+begin_src sh
objdump -h obj/kern/kernel

#output:

#+end_src

Take particular note of the /"VMA"/ (or link address) and the /"LMA"/ (or load address) of the .text section. 

The _load address_ of a section is the memory address at which that section should be loaded into memory.

The _link address_ of a section is the memory address from which the section expects to execute. 

***** DONE [Exercise 5] Identify errors
Identify the first instruction that would "break" or 
otherwise do the wrong thing if you were to get the boot loader's link address wrong. 

***** DONE [Exercise 6] Examine memory using GDB's x command
**** NEXT [1/3] The *kernel*
***** DONE Using virtual memory to work around position dependence
- *Question*: In kernel, why the /LMA/ is not the same as /VMA/ just like bootloader??

From MIT page: In fact, in the next lab, we will map the entire bottom 256MB of the PC's physical address space, 
from physical addresses 0x00000000 through 0x0fffffff, to virtual addresses 0xf0000000 through 0xffffffff respectively. 
You should now see why JOS can only use the first 256MB of physical memory.

****** DONE [Exercise 7] Trace JOS kernel
Command:
#+begin_src sh
objdump -f obj/kern/kernel

# output:
obj/kern/kernel:     file format elf32-i386
architecture: i386, flags 0x00000112:
EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED
start address 0x0010000c

#+end_src

Where I knew that the kernel starts to run ar address _0x0010000c_

Therefore, start GDB, set break point at _0x0010000c_ and use x/i to see inside commands:
#+begin_src sh
b *0x0010000c

# got:
(gdb) x/4i 0x100000
   0x100000:	add    0x1bad(%eax),%dh
   0x100006:	add    %al,(%eax)
   0x100008:	decb   0x52(%edi)
   0x10000b:	in     $0x66,%al
(gdb) x/4i 0xf0100000
   0xf0100000 <_start+4026531828>:	add    %al,(%eax)
   0xf0100002 <_start+4026531830>:	add    %al,(%eax)
   0xf0100004 <_start+4026531832>:	add    %al,(%eax)
   0xf0100006 <_start+4026531834>:	add    %al,(%eax)

Here, contents in 0x100000 and 0xf0100000 are different;

si some steps ->

(gdb) x/4i 0x100000
   0x100000:	add    0x1bad(%eax),%dh
   0x100006:	add    %al,(%eax)
   0x100008:	decb   0x52(%edi)
   0x10000b:	in     $0x66,%al
(gdb) x/4i 0xf0100000
   0xf0100000 <_start+4026531828>:	add    0x1bad(%eax),%dh
   0xf0100006 <_start+4026531834>:	add    %al,(%eax)
   0xf0100008 <_start+4026531836>:	decb   0x52(%edi)
   0xf010000b <_start+4026531839>:	in     $0x66,%al

Wow, contents are the same now.

***** NEXT Formatted Printing to the Console
Most people take functions like /printf()/ for granted, sometimes even thinking of them as "primitives" of the C language. 
But in an OS kernel, we have to implement all I/O ourselves.

****** DONE Read through /kern/printf.c, lib/printfmt.c,/ and /kern/console.c/
Their *relationships*:
/printf.c/ is based on /printfmt.c/;

/printf.c/ and /printfmt.c/ all based on /console.c/;

Function /vcprintf/ uses function /vprintfmt/ in /printfmt.c/,
Function /putch/ uses function /cputchar/ in /console.c/,
Functions in /printfmt.c/ uses function /putch/;

****** DONE [Exercise 8] Complete vprintfmt '%o' format
Open /printfmt.c/, found lines below:
#+begin_src c
// (unsigned) octal
	case 'o':
		// Replace this with your code.
		putch('X', putdat);
		putch('X', putdat);
		putch('X', putdat);
		break;
#+end_src

Modify it:
#+begin_src c
// (unsigned) octal
	case 'o':
		// Replace this with your code.
		num = getuint(&ap, lflag);
                base = 8;
		goto number;
#+end_src

before modified, if we start qemu($ make qemu), found:
#+begin_src
6828 decimal is XXX octal!
#+end_src
After:
#+begin_src
6828 decimal is 15254 octal!
#end_src

****** NEXT Answering questions
- Explain the interface between /printf.c/ and /console.c/. 
  Specifically, what function does console.c export? How is this function used by printf.c?

  A: /cputchar/

- Explain the following from /console.c/:
  #+begin_src c
if (crt_pos >= CRT_SIZE) {
              int i;
              memmove(crt_buf, crt_buf + CRT_COLS, (CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS) * sizeof(uint16_t));
              for (i = CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS; i < CRT_SIZE; i++)
                      crt_buf[i] = 0x0700 | ' ';
              crt_pos -= CRT_COLS;
}
  #+end_src

  A: Since CRT_SIZE is not big enough to hold crt_pos, page has to roll.

- For the following questions you might wish to consult the notes for Lecture 2. 
  These notes cover GCC's calling convention on the x86.
  Trace the execution of the following code step-by-step:

  #+begin_src c
int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;
cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);
  #+end_src

  - In the call to cprintf(), to what does fmt point? To what does ap point?

  - List (in order of execution) each call to cons_putc, va_arg, and vcprintf. For cons_putc, list its argument as well. 
    For va_arg, list what ap points to before and after the call. For vcprintf list the values of its two arguments.


- Run the following code.
  #+begin_src c
unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
cprintf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
  #+end_src
